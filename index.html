      <h1>Matthew Baker</h1>
      <h2 id="type">Software Developer</h2>
      <h2>Codeup Graduate - Jupiter</h2>
      <p>Solution driven, full-stack software developer looking to solve
        real world business problems with technical solutions.
        As a former repair technician, I have cultivated a passion for problem solving and collaborating
        with others to brainstorm unique solutions to any challenges in my path.
        Transitioning into software development has proven to be the best
        decision of my life as it has ignited the same level of passion for solving problems but in a new way.</p>

    <h3 class="projectName">ShareCast</h3>
    <p>ShareCast is a social media application designed to be a central
      location for like-minded podcast enthusiasts to get together
      and collaborate on new ideas. ShareCast allows users to easily
      share their favorite podcasts while being able to find guest
      speakers for any podcasts they may be working on. As a registered user,
      podcasters can add their podcasts to the site, get recommendations from
      the site to discover new podcasts, listen and comment on other users'
      creations. This application was built using Java, Springboot, MySql,
      Materialize CSS, JavaScript, HTML and the Filestack API.</p>

    <h3 class="projectName">Sorting Visualizer</h3>
    <h4><a href="https://mdbaker19.github.io/Visual-Sorting-algo/sorting.html">Try it here</a> </h4>
    <p>Sorting Visualizer is an application used to visualize the process of
      different sorting algorithms. Made using HTML canvas and JS, a user
      can select from different algorithms, cycle speed, amount of towers
      and various number ranges and animate the sorting process.
      Building this application helped me understand how time complexity differs between algorithms.</p>

    <h3 class="projectName">Flash Cards</h3>
    <h4><a href="https://mdbaker19.github.io/study-flash-cards/">See it here</a> </h4>
    <p>Flash Cards is an application built with a fellow classmate that
      allows users to upload custom flash cards to a JSON server for
      any other users to then use and study the material. The site
      was created to help provide quality material to myself and my
      fellow classmates as we progressed through Codeup. Built with JS, HTML,
      CSS and Glitch JSON server.</p>

    <h3 class="projectName">Master Mind</h3>
    <h4><a href="https://mdbaker19.github.io/MasterMind-project/">Play it here</a> </h4>
    <p>Master Mind is a project based off of one of my favorite board game from the 70's.
      Using Html, CSS, JS and jQuery this is a recreation of this classic game
      with added features to change the difficulty by allowing the user to choose
      different amount of color choices to play from. While working on this
      project throughout my time at Codeup, I learned how to refactor old code
      and diagnose bugs to improve an old project as well as taking in feedback
      and improving UI. Built using HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery.</p>
